## Why Ekklesia?

WordPress is overkill and culturally misaligned. Church management tools built for Western congregations don't understand African workflows. **Ekklesia is the tool that was missing.**

It handles what African churches actually need: sermon archives with audio and video, event management, member directories, giving records, multilingual announcements — all from a clean admin panel that non-technical pastors and church secretaries can use with confidence.

And because it is open source, it belongs to the community it serves.
